# 🖥️ Chomp API

A lightweight, CPU-based graphics API built entirely from scratch.  
Chomp API was an experimental project exploring graphics programming and low-level rendering techniques.

> ⚠️ **Discontinued:** Chomp API is no longer actively maintained, but it remains a showcase of CPU-based graphics rendering.
